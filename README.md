# Lab-project Java-FX Terminal
# File system emulator

The user can work with the following commands:
● ls - lists all the content if the folder it is inside
● mkdir fld - creates folder named fld
● cd fld - accesses folder named fld
● touch fln - creates an empty file named fln
● rm fln - removes a file named fln
● rmdir fld - removes a folder named fld
● cd .. - moves the user up one folder
● cd fld1/fld2 - accesses folder named fld2 inside a folder named fld1

● pwd - prints the full path to the current working folder from Root
folder
When the program starts for the first time it only has one folder named
Root, the user is inside the Root and every command he/she writes is
performed inside that folder.
